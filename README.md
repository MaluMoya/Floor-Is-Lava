# Floor is Lava!

## Description

Floor is lava is a fun game to play around in real life. This is a  first version of a video game.

This video game, constantly references a main grid to move around the player (water character), the enemy (lava character) and pieces of wood that will save the player from burning. 

Main elements:

Timer that controls a countdown.
Dice that controls the amount of movements of the player.
Remaining moves count to keep track of the rolling dice.

## Project Planning

My project is divided in 3 smaller tasks. I used trello to organize and keep track of my project. I also used a wireframe to have a better idea of how my game will look like.
